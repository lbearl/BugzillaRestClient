BugzillaRestClient
==================

#About
The BugzillaRestClient is a Java library which consumes the Bugzilla bzApi (currently), and should consume the official Bugzilla REST API when it is released to a production build.

Note that this library is in *very* early development, and will more than likely break. You have been warned.
